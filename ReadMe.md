### final 
- *final* keyword is used in different contexts. First of all, *final* is a non-access modifier(비접근 제어자) applicable only to a variable, a method, or a class.
  - Final Variable : To Create constant variable
    - When a variable is declared as final, its value cannot be changed once it has been initialized. This is useful for declaring constants or other values that should not be modified.
  - Final Methods : Prevent Method Overriding
    - When a method is declared as final, it cannot be overridden by a subclass. This is useful for methods that are part of a class's public API and should not be modified by subclasses.
  - Final Classes : Prevent Inheritance 
    - When a class is declared as final, it cannot be extended by a subclass. This is useful for classes that are intended to be used as is and should not be modified or extended.
